## Data analysis for predicting air pollutant concentration in Smart city Uppsala

Pollution concentrations in urban areas are primarily from vehicular exhaust, factories, and small scale industries. 
Recent studies conducted by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) says that 3000-5000 premature deaths 
occur every year as a result of inhaling a high level of pollution concentrations like PM10, PM2.5, CO, Nitrogen Oxides 
(NO+NO2). A sustainable lifestyle in an urban city-like environment is thus possible only through smart city style urban 
management.Foreseeing the future, the Uppsala Municipality along with the help of IBM, Ericsson, and the Uppsala University 
has initiated a smart city project in Uppsala. The thrust of this initiative would be deploying pollution detection sensors 
all over Uppsala city and monitoring pollution concentrations continuously throughout the day. The data collected will then 
be passed to a knowledge discovery process that would forecast pollution concentration for the future, and will be presented 
in a user-friendly format in real-time using an Android application. This application will provide users with real-time 
pollution concentration level along with the predicted value of the location thereby helping in raising awareness of its 
causes and consequences.The main focus of this thesis will be in exploring the suitable data mining technique that will help 
in better forecasting of the pollution concentration. In addition to the data model, it also focuses on the design and 
implementation of an Android application targeted towards the people of Uppsala community.
